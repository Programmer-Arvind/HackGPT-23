# Welcome to our HackGPT - 23 project

HackGPT - 23 is a hackathon conducted by IIT Patna (Celesta'23).

We are making a basic *Travel companion* called **JourneyPal** with GPT-3.5-Turbo API (free version).

The webpage of this project is called JourneyPal

---
### Problem Statement:
  When thinking of a place to travel we often don't know much about the popular tourist places,
  the delicacies or the most important - The common phrases used to communicate better with the locals.

### Project Description and the usage of GPT 3.5 Turbo
  Its a fairly simple and straightforward webpage which asks the user for the destination the user wants to go. Then the GPT-3.5-turbo processes the input and smartly generates the outputs which includes the
  * Most common *must* know phrases - And their english translations
  * *Must* visit tourist places - Their small description
  * *Must* taste delicacies - How it looks and tastes
